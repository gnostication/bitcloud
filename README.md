# Welcome to Bitcloud

Bitcloud is a universal protocol aiming to provide a massive distributed
database and filesystem, or "virtual
hard disk", capable of storing data encrypted and signed across all connected
nodes, protecting privacy and guaranteeing quality of service (QoS).

# Introduction

Bitcloud can be the base for decentralized applications that require data
storage and bandwidth. There are many Bitcoin 2.0 projects in the works right
now, but they all still rely on some type of blockchain. In Bitcloud, the
blockchain is replaced by a distributed database, also known as the
nodepool. Bitcloud creates a new decentralized system of trust where entire
web applications can be hosted without a centralized server.

Bitcloud is *coin agnostic*, meaning that it only intends to be the base for
the storage needs of future Distributed Applications (DAs). Bitcloud can use the escrow capabilities of
Bitcoin and/or the contracts of Ethereum. Bitcloud intends to substitute the
way in which servers interconnect today and make it much easier, more secure and
more private for users, publishers and DAs to share files. It will be *fundamental*
for the upcoming DAs.

Whether you're watching videos from YouTube or listening to music on
Soundcloud, you're getting all of your content through one centralized
source. That centralized source could decide to delete certain content or be
forced to delete controversial content by a local government. The core
principles behind the applications built on top of Bitcloud are
decentralization, complete autonomy, open source, and the choice of anonymity.

# Help Work With Us

We want to make the process of creating Bitcloud *extremely* open, allowing
anyone who wants to participate to share their opinion and help with the
project.

Look at our current team [here](http://bitcloudproject.org/w/Team).

Watch us at github.

And, most importantly, join us [here](http://bitcloudproject.org/w/Join_Us).

# What are we doing now?

We have mostly finished the design stage! We are fully entering the programming stage now.

Heres the plan for Alpha Development:

Design Documentation:
  -Nodepool.sql Specifications
  -Compnent Function Specification
  -Functional Requirements
  -Process Diagrams
  -Component Dependencies
  -Possible UML, Schema, and other Diagrams

Develop Components:
  -

Testing:
  -Test locally on many machines
    -Solve any errors
  -Build and test an Alpha Grid
    -Fix any errors

Move on to Beta!

# New node.js version for PoC

We have decided to create the first PoC version using node.js.
We hope that this decission will make many developers happy to contribute
to the project.
